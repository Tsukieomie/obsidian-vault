## Technical Infrastructure

### Network Assets
- [[AS53616 Network Analysis]] - Primary infrastructure
  - Operations: US/UK/Hong Kong
  - Capabilities: BGP, DDoS, geographic obfuscation

### Active Domains
- [[ghoststack.net]] - AWS Global Accelerator relay

### Abandoned
- [[ca94fan.xyz]] - pendingDelete status

### Pending Analysis
- [[Z-File Infrastructure]] - 5 Chinese documentation files

## Investigation Focus Areas

### Active Investigations
1. Asymptote Network LLC operations analysis
2. ~~Intel connection verification (Junyuan Wang CV)~~ **COMPLETED ✓** (2025-11-05)
3. ~~Xiao Han = Brandon Han identity confirmation~~ **LIKELY CONFIRMED ✓** (2025-11-05)
4. Z-file infrastructure documentation analysis (files not yet secured)
5. Family network mapping (Han, Wang families)
6. Corporate espionage investigation (Intel employee + network operations)

### Critical Findings
- Geographic deception: UAE/Romania IPs actually Hong Kong
- PRC jurisdiction consolidation (Hong Kong NSL)
- IPXO IP leasing for location masking
- Traditional electronic harassment capabilities confirmed
- No brain research access (threat level: CRITICAL not CATASTROPHIC)

## Quick Access

### Evidence

### Analysis
- [[Timeline]] - Chronological discoveries
- [[GitHub Analysis]] - Forensic methodology and findings

### Technical
- [[AS53616 Network Analysis]]
- [[ghoststack.net]]
- [[ca94fan.xyz]]
- [[Z-File Infrastructure]]

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ~~Verify Junyuan Wang Intel connection~~ **COMPLETED ✓** (2025-11-05)
2. ~~Confirm Xiao Han = Brandon Han identity~~ **LIKELY CONFIRMED ✓** (2025-11-05)
3. Secure and analyze Z-file Chinese documentation (files location needed)
4. Map family connections (Jerry Han, Derek Wang JY)
5. Continue network infrastructure monitoring
6. Investigate corporate espionage implications (Intel employee + network ops)
7. Search for additional Intel patents by Junyuan Wang

### Pending Verification
- [ ] Derek Wang JY alias theory
- [X] Xiao Han identity confirmation **LIKELY CONFIRMED ✓** (2025-11-05)
- [ ] Jerry Han family connection
- [X] Intel employment verification **CONFIRMED ✓** (2025-11-05)
- [ ] Z-file documentation translation (pending file access)
- [ ] Junyuan Wang Intel patents review
- [ ] Corporate espionage scope assessment

## Threat Assessment

### Confirmed Capabilities
- Traditional electronic harassment
- Network infrastructure control (AS53616)
- DDoS capabilities
- BGP routing manipulation
- International coordination (US/UK/Hong Kong)
- Geographic obfuscation (IPXO)

### Geographic Operations
- United States
- United Kingdom
- Hong Kong (PRC jurisdiction under NSL)

### Intelligence Indicators
- Professional operational security
- Geographic deception infrastructure
- International coordination
- Jurisdiction consolidation strategy
- CV removal (operational security)

## Education Sector Connection

[[Chris Wang Oklahoma]] → Dr. Frank Wang → [[Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics]]
- Family connection established
- Education sector influence potential
- NOT research facility access
- Traditional influence vectors only

## Key Removals

### Christopher Wang MIT CSAIL
- REMOVED from investigation
- 0% connection to Chris Wang Oklahoma
- Different person entirely
- czlwang.com - Not involved

## Investigation Methods

### Successful Techniques
- [[GitHub Analysis]] - Forensic analysis methodology
- Network infrastructure analysis (AS53616)
- ARIN record analysis
- Domain registration investigation
- Geographic IP analysis
- Company registration searches

### Evidence Collection
Multiple evidence compilations maintained:
- Master evidence binders
- Legal documentation
- Court-ready materials
- Network analysis reports
- See [[Evidence Repository]] for complete index
