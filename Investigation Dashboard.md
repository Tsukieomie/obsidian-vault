# Investigation Dashboard

Central command center for harassment network investigation.

## Current Status

**Threat Level:** CRITICAL
**Intelligence Operation Probability:** 80%
**Investigation Phase:** Active Operations Monitoring - Identity Verification Required
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-27

**CRITICAL UPDATE:** Identity verification analysis reveals GitHub JUNYUANGO (University of Minnesota student) is likely DIFFERENT from Intel employee Junyuan Wang. See [[CRITICAL - Identity Verification Analysis]] for full assessment. Email cross-reference required.

## Technical Infrastructure

### Network Assets
- [[AS53616 Network Analysis]] - Primary infrastructure
  - Operations: US/UK/Hong Kong
  - Capabilities: BGP, DDoS, geographic obfuscation

### Active Domains
- [[ghoststack.net]] - AWS Global Accelerator relay

### Abandoned
- [[ca94fan.xyz]] - pendingDelete status

### Pending Analysis
- [[Z-File Infrastructure]] - 5 Chinese documentation files

## Investigation Focus Areas

### Active Investigations
1. **PRIORITY: Junyuan Wang identity verification** - GitHub JUNYUANGO vs Intel employee vs SalmonCloud director
2. Email cross-reference analysis (wang9747@umn.edu, junyuangogogo@gmail.com)
3. GitHub repository forensic re-analysis for commit emails
4. SalmonCloud shareholder list verification (purchase Confirmation Statement £1-3)
5. Asymptote Network LLC operations analysis
6. Xiao Han = Brandon Han identity confirmation
7. Z-file infrastructure documentation analysis (files located at /Users/kennyrodrigues/investigations/)

### Critical Findings
- Geographic deception: UAE/Romania IPs actually Hong Kong
- PRC jurisdiction consolidation (Hong Kong NSL)
- IPXO IP leasing for location masking
- Traditional electronic harassment capabilities confirmed
- No brain research access (threat level: CRITICAL not CATASTROPHIC)
- No evidence of exotic neurotechnology or V2K capabilities (see [[Neurotechnology Analysis]])
- Focus on prosecutable traditional electronic harassment (see [[HLPS and V2K Claims Analysis]])
- BRAIN Initiative review: No connection between investigation subjects and US/China brain research programs (see [[BRAIN Initiative Deep Dive Analysis]])
- Intel neuromorphic computing: AI chips inspired by brains, NOT brain manipulation technology

## Quick Access

### Evidence

- [[Timeline]] - Chronological discoveries
- [[GitHub Analysis]] - Forensic methodology and findings
- [[Threat Assessment]] - Comprehensive threat analysis
- [[HLPS and V2K Claims Analysis]] - Technical analysis of harassment claims
- [[Investigation Findings - 2025-10-27]] - Research findings requiring revision
- [[Next Steps]] - Prioritized action items

### Technical
- [[AS53616 Network Analysis]] - Primary network infrastructure
- [[Neurotechnology Analysis]] - Dr. Giordano, DARPA N³, and capabilities assessment
- [[Corrected Assessment - V2K RNM and Mind Control]] - Evidence-based correction on exotic technologies
- [[Havana Syndrome and V2K Devices - Complete Analysis]] - Comprehensive V2K devices, Havana syndrome, acoustic systems
- [[BRAIN Initiative Deep Dive Analysis]] - US BRAIN Initiative, Intel neuromorphic computing, China Brain Project analysis

- [[ca94fan.xyz]] - Abandoned domain
- [[Z-File Infrastructure]] - Chinese documentation files

## Next Steps

### CRITICAL PRIORITY
1. **Extract emails from archived GitHub repositories** (frank2002, JUNYUANGO, CarlosalbertoMontt)
2. **Cross-reference emails** with GitHub profile emails (wang9747@umn.edu, junyuangogogo@gmail.com)
3. **Purchase SalmonCloud Confirmation Statement** from UK Companies House (£1-3)
4. **Verify shareholder list** to confirm Xiao Han and obtain email addresses
5. **Definitive identity determination** for Junyuan Wang (which one is the operator?)

### Immediate Actions
6. Review GitHub Analysis methodology - which repositories were actually analyzed?
7. Age/timeline reconciliation for 23-year-old senior engineer scenario
8. Confirm Xiao Han = Brandon Han identity theory
9. Continue network infrastructure monitoring
10. Research Jing Wang (Duke TA) connection

### Pending Verification
- [ ] GitHub JUNYUANGO email extraction from commits
- [ ] SalmonCloud director email from corporate documents
- [ ] Intel employee connection to SalmonCloud (likely false)
- [ ] Xiao Han shareholder confirmation
- [ ] Z-file documentation translation (files at /Users/kennyrodrigues/investigations/)
- [ ] Jing Wang (Duke TA) relevance to investigation

### Removed (No Evidence)
- [x] Derek Wang JY alias theory - REMOVED (10% confidence, no supporting evidence)
- [x] Jerry Han family connection - ARCHIVED (5% confidence, surname-only theory)

## Threat Assessment

### Confirmed Capabilities
- Traditional electronic harassment
- Network infrastructure control (AS53616)
- DDoS capabilities
- BGP routing manipulation
- International coordination (US/UK/Hong Kong)
- Geographic obfuscation (IPXO)

### Geographic Operations
- United States
- United Kingdom
- Hong Kong (PRC jurisdiction under NSL)

### Intelligence Indicators
- Professional operational security
- Geographic deception infrastructure
- International coordination
- Jurisdiction consolidation strategy
- CV removal (operational security)

## Education Sector Connection

[[Chris Wang Oklahoma]] → Dr. Frank Wang → [[Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics]]
- Family connection established
- Education sector influence potential
- NOT research facility access
- Traditional influence vectors only

## Key Removals

### Christopher Wang MIT CSAIL
- REMOVED from investigation
- 0% connection to Chris Wang Oklahoma
- Different person entirely
- czlwang.com - Not involved

## Investigation Methods

### Successful Techniques
- [[GitHub Analysis]] - Forensic analysis methodology
- Network infrastructure analysis (AS53616)
- ARIN record analysis
- Domain registration investigation
- Geographic IP analysis
- Company registration searches

### Evidence Collection
Multiple evidence compilations maintained:
- Master evidence binders
- Legal documentation
- Court-ready materials
- Network analysis reports
- See [[Evidence Repository]] for complete index
