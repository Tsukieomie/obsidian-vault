## Understanding Threat Levels

### CRITICAL (Current Level)
- Professional operation
- State-level resources possible
- Active operations
- Traditional electronic harassment
- Network infrastructure control

### Not CATASTROPHIC (Why?)
- No brain research access confirmed
- [[Chris Wang Oklahoma]] ≠ Christopher Wang MIT CSAIL
- No advanced neurotechnology
- Traditional methods only

## Key Investigation Principles

### Evidence Standards
- **Verified**: Multiple independent sources
- **Pending**: Single source, awaiting confirmation
- **Theory**: Hypothesis requiring investigation
- **Removed**: Disproven or 0% connection

### Connection Confidence
- **100%**: Absolute confirmation (e.g., [[Junyuan Wang]])
- **90-99%**: Very high confidence
- **70-89%**: High confidence
- **50-69%**: Medium confidence
- **Under Investigation**: Insufficient data

### Documentation Practice
- Always cite sources
- Link to evidence
- Note confidence levels
- Cross-reference entities
- Update regularly

## Current Priorities (from [[Action Items]])

### Critical Priority
1. **Intel Connection Verification** - [[Junyuan Wang]]
2. **Xiao Han Identity Confirmation** - [[Brandon Han]]
3. **Z-File Documentation Analysis** - [[Z-File Infrastructure]]

### High Priority
1. Derek Wang JY alias investigation
2. Jerry Han family connection
3. Jing Wang Duke investigation
