- Status: ACTIVE THREAT INFRASTRUCTURE (Verified 2025-11-04)
- Classification: Traditional electronic harassment capabilities
- ARIN Status: Active and in good standing
- Last ARIN Update: 2024-04-12

## Network Characteristics

### Geographic Operations
- United States
- United Kingdom
- Hong Kong (PRC jurisdiction under Hong Kong NSL)

### Geographic Deception
- UAE/Romania IPs are actually Hong Kong locations
- IPXO IP leasing service used for obfuscation
- Real operations consolidated under PRC jurisdiction
- Purpose: Mask true operational locations

## Technical Capabilities

### Network Operations
- BGP routing control
- DDoS infrastructure
- International network coordination
- IP address leasing and rotation

### Infrastructure Components
- [[ghoststack.net]] - Active relay
  - AWS Global Accelerator enabled
  - Currently operational
- [[ca94fan.xyz]] - Abandoned
  - pendingDelete status
  - No longer active

## IPXO IP Leasing
- Service: IP address leasing platform
- Usage: Geographic obfuscation
- Effect: Makes Hong Kong operations appear as UAE/Romania
- Purpose: Jurisdiction confusion, attribution evasion

## Associated Domains
