## Network Technical Specifications

### BGP and Peering

**Autonomous System:** AS53616
**Network Type:** Carrier
**Peering Status:** Active and extensive

**Peering Statistics:**
- **Total Peer Networks:** 317 confirmed
- **Upstream Carriers:** 5
- **Network Reach:** International (US, UK, Hong Kong, via peers worldwide)

**IPv4 Prefixes Originated:** 9
**IPv6 Prefixes Originated:** 9

**First IP Allocation:** 38.224.163.0/24 (allocated 2024-06-24)

**Assessment:** Carrier-grade peering indicates professional, well-resourced network operation. 317 peers is significant for harassment operation - suggests either legitimate business cover or substantial technical sophistication.

### Network Infrastructure

**Confirmed Operational Locations:**

1. **San Jose, California (United States)**
   - Primary datacenter facility
   - Silicon Valley location
   - High-speed connectivity
   - North American operations hub
   - Professional datacenter environment

2. **Hong Kong**
   - Asian operations hub
   - PRC jurisdiction (Hong Kong National Security Law)
   - International connectivity
   - Geographic obfuscation base
   - Used for IP masking operations

3. **United Kingdom**
   - Network presence confirmed (peering/routing)
   - Possible SalmonCloud Ltd connection
   - International operations coordination

**Registration Address:**
- Dover, Delaware (LLC registration only, not operational)

## Geographic Operations

### Geographic Deception Tactics

**IPXO IP Leasing:**
- Service used for geographic obfuscation
- Leases IP addresses with false geographic attribution
- Makes Hong Kong operations appear as UAE/Romania
- Purpose: Jurisdiction confusion, attribution evasion

**Deception Pattern:**
- **Apparent Location:** UAE, Romania (via leased IPs)
- **Actual Location:** Hong Kong
- **Effect:** Operations consolidated under PRC jurisdiction
- **Legal Implication:** Hong Kong National Security Law applies

**Assessment:** Sophisticated operational security demonstrating awareness of legal/jurisdictional issues. Geographic deception suggests intent to evade attribution and legal consequences.

### PRC Jurisdiction Consolidation

**Hong Kong Operations:**
- Actual base of IP obfuscation operations
- Subject to Hong Kong National Security Law (2020)
- PRC jurisdiction despite separate legal system
- Reduces Western law enforcement access
- Complicates international legal cooperation

**Strategic Assessment:** Deliberate consolidation under PRC-controlled jurisdiction suggests either state sponsorship or awareness that PRC jurisdiction provides legal shelter from Western prosecution.
