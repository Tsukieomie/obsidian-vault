---

Create a new organization entity profile in the Entities/Organizations/ folder.

Follow these steps:
1. Ask the user for the organization name
2. Use the Organization Template from Templates/Organization Template.md
3. Create the file in Entities/Organizations/ with the organization name as filename
4. Fill in whatever information the user provides
5. Add the organization to Entity Index.md
6. Add an entry to Timeline.md documenting the discovery
7. Update Investigation Dashboard.md if this is a significant target

Prompt the user for:
- Legal name and common name (if different)
- Type (company, nonprofit, government, etc.)
- Status (active, inactive, under investigation)
- Threat level (critical, high, medium, low)
- Registration information (if known)
- Key people associated
- Business activities
- Technical infrastructure (domains, IPs, AS numbers)

After creating the profile, confirm the file location and ask if they want to add this organization to any analysis documents.
