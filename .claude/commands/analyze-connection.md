description: Analyze connections between two or more entities
---

Analyze and document connections between entities in the investigation.

Follow these steps:
1. Ask the user which entities they want to analyze (minimum 2)
2. Read the entity profiles for all mentioned entities
3. Search for connections across all vault documents
4. Analyze the connection strength and type

For each connection, determine:
- Direct connections (explicitly documented)
- Indirect connections (through intermediaries)
- Connection type (family, business, technical, geographic)
- Evidence supporting the connection
- Confidence level
- Significance to investigation

Present analysis including:
- Connection diagram (ASCII art showing relationships)
- Evidence for each connection
- Strength/confidence assessment
- Investigative significance
- Gaps in understanding
- Recommended verification steps

After analysis, ask if the user wants to:
- Update Connection Map.md
- Update entity profiles with new connection details
- Create action items for verification
- Update Evidence Tracking with connection evidence

Output should help determine if entities are:
- Directly connected (proven relationship)
- Likely connected (strong evidence)
- Possibly connected (circumstantial evidence)
- Not connected (insufficient evidence)
