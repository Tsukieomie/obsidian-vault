description: Perform risk assessment for an entity or threat
---

Perform a comprehensive risk assessment for an entity, threat, or situation.

Follow these steps:
1. Ask the user what they want to assess (entity, threat type, or situation)
2. Read relevant documents (Risk Matrix, Threat Assessment, entity profiles)
3. Use the Risk Matrix methodology: Risk = Likelihood × Impact

For the assessment:

**Likelihood Scale (1-5)**
- VERY HIGH (5): >75% probability
- HIGH (4): 50-75% probability
- MEDIUM (3): 25-50% probability
- LOW (2): 10-25% probability
- VERY LOW (1): <10% probability

**Impact Scale (1-5)**
- CATASTROPHIC (5): Life-threatening, severe permanent harm
- CRITICAL (4): Significant harm, long-term effects
- HIGH (3): Moderate harm, medium-term effects
- MEDIUM (2): Minor harm, short-term effects
- LOW (1): Negligible harm

**Calculate Risk Score**: Likelihood × Impact = Risk (1-25)

Present assessment including:
- Risk description
- Likelihood assessment with justification
- Impact assessment with justification
- Risk score calculation
- Risk level (CATASTROPHIC/CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Contributing factors
- Existing mitigations
- Recommended additional mitigations
- Risk comparison to other threats

After assessment, ask if the user wants to:
- Update Risk Matrix.md with this assessment
- Update Threat Assessment.md
- Create action items for mitigation
- Update entity profiles with risk information

Track how mitigations could reduce risk score.
