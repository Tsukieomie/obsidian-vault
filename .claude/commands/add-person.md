Create a new person entity profile in the Entities/People/ folder.

Follow these steps:
1. Ask the user for the person's name
2. Use the Person Template from Templates/Person Template.md
3. Create the file in Entities/People/ with the person's name as filename
4. Fill in whatever information the user provides
5. Add the person to Entity Index.md
6. Add an entry to Timeline.md documenting the discovery
7. Update Investigation Dashboard.md if this is a significant target

Prompt the user for:
- Full name
- Connection confidence percentage (if known)
- Role in the investigation
- Any known identifiers (email, GitHub, phone, etc.)
- Connections to other entities
- Initial evidence or sources

After creating the profile, confirm the file location and ask if they want to add this person to any analysis documents.
