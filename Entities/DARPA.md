# DARPA
**Full Name:** Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
**Type:** Military Research Organization
**Parent:** U.S. Department of Defense
**Status:** Active - Critical Investigation Target

## Overview
DARPA is the primary military research arm driving neurotechnology development in the United States. Core partner in the BRAIN Initiative alongside NIH and NSF.

## Key Programs
