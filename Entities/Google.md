- FISA court orders
- Backdoor access for agencies

## Internet of Bodies Role

### Infrastructure Provider
- Network backbone
- Data processing/storage
- AI analysis capabilities
- Integration with IoT/IoB devices

### Data Aggregation
- Cross-service data linking
- Behavioral + Biological profiles
- Predictive modeling
