## Overview
- **Connection Confidence: <5% - EXTREMELY LOW**
- Status: LOW PRIORITY - Surname-only theory
- Institution: Duke University (alleged TA)
- Theory: Possible connection to Wang network

## Investigation Analysis - 2025-10-27

**Research Conducted:**
- Web search for "Jing Wang Duke University teaching assistant"
- Computer science and networking faculty searches
- LinkedIn and professional profile searches
- Academic directory searches

**Findings:**
- NO CURRENT TA named Jing Wang found at Duke University
- Multiple historical Jing Wang associations with Duke:
  - Jing Wang (Professor): Faculty at Duke 1985-2001, then moved to MIT
  - Jing Wang (Postdoctoral Associate): Former researcher, now at Iowa State
  - Jing An (current): Assistant Research Professor in Mathematics (not Jing Wang)
- NO connection to investigation subjects found
- NO network or computer science specialization found for current "Jing Wang"

**Assessment:**
"Wang" (王) is THE MOST COMMON Chinese surname:
- Approximately 100+ million people worldwide
- ~92 million in mainland China alone
- Accounts for ~7.25% of Chinese population
- Statistical probability of random unrelated individuals: EXTREMELY HIGH

**Probability of Connection to Investigation:** <5% (lower than random chance)

**Recommendation:** ARCHIVE - No evidence of relevance to investigation

## Surname Statistics Context

**Wang (王) - Most Common Chinese Surname:**
- Global population: 100+ million people
- Mainland China: ~92 million
- Percentage of Chinese population: 7.25%

- Roger Wang: 70% connection (evidence unclear)
- Jing Wang: Duke TA (alleged, unverified, no connection found)

**Statistical Reality:**
With 100+ million people named Wang globally, surname similarity alone provides NO investigative value without additional connecting evidence.

  - Specific evidence connecting Jing Wang to investigation subjects emerges
  - Full email address is verified and shows connection to network infrastructure
  - Geographic/institutional overlap with confirmed subjects is discovered
  - Business/financial/operational connections are found
  - Direct mention in investigation subject communications

## Research History
- 2025-10-27: Comprehensive web searches conducted
- Result: NO evidence of connection to investigation
- Conclusion: Surname-only theory, insufficient evidence for active investigation

**NOTE:** This represents the third surname-based lead with insufficient evidence (Derek Wang JY, Jerry Han, Jing Wang). Investigation must focus on evidence-based connections rather than surname similarity alone, especially with extremely common surnames like Wang (100M+) and Han (18M+).

**LESSON:** Surname similarity with common Chinese/Korean surnames provides negligible investigative value. Future leads must have concrete evidence beyond name similarity.
