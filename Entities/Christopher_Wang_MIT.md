# Christopher Wang (MIT)
**Type:** Academic Researcher
**Institution:** Massachusetts Institute of Technology
**Status:** DARPA Research Pipeline Connection
**Priority:** HIGH - Academic-Military Bridge

## Overview

Christopher Wang is a researcher at MIT whose work connects to the broader DARPA BRAIN Initiative academic research pipeline. MIT receives substantial DARPA, NIH, and NSF funding for neurotechnology research.

## Academic Profile

**Institution:** Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
**Research Focus:** Neural activity and brain signals (specific details to be verified)
**Connection Type:** Part of DARPA-funded academic research ecosystem

## MIT's Role in DARPA BRAIN

### Institutional Connections
- **Funding Sources:** DARPA, [[Entities/NIH|NIH]], [[Entities/NSF|NSF]]
- **Key Programs:** N3 Program participation (institutional)
- **Related Labs:** MITRE Labs, various neuroscience departments

### Notable MIT BRAIN Researchers
- **Ed Boyden:** Optogenetics, neural engineering
- **Gang Chen:** Solar nanotechnology (**arrested by FBI for China ties, 2019**)
- **Christopher Wang:** Neural activity research (this investigation)

## Technology Transfer Concerns

### Pattern: MIT → Corporate/Foreign
```
MIT Research (DARPA/NIH funded)
    ↓
Patent Development
    ↓
Technology Transfer Options:
    → U.S. Corporations (Google, Apple, etc.)
    → Foreign Adversaries (Gang Chen case)
    → Defense Contractors (Battelle, Raytheon)
```

### Gang Chen Precedent
**Significance:** MIT researcher arrested for technology transfer to China
**Implication:** DARPA-funded research reaching foreign adversaries
**Pattern:** Same institution, same funding sources
**Risk:** Christopher Wang research could follow similar path

## Connection to Investigation

### DARPA Academic Pipeline
**Function:** Universities develop technologies for DARPA
- Receive grants for neurotechnology research
- File patents on discoveries
- Transfer to corporate/military deployment
- **No oversight on final use**

### Role in Larger Network

## Investigation Priorities

### Immediate Research Needed
- [ ] Identify specific Christopher Wang(s) at MIT
- [ ] Determine exact neural research focus
- [ ] Identify funding sources (DARPA/NIH/NSF grants)
- [ ] Review publication record
- [ ] Check patent filings
- [ ] Verify corporate connections
- [ ] Investigate China connections

### FOIA Requests
- [ ] NIH grants to MIT neuroscience departments
- [ ] NSF awards involving neural research
- [ ] DARPA contracts with MIT (any involving Wang)
- [ ] Publication records with government funding acknowledgments

### Patent Search
**Search Terms:**
- Inventor: "Christopher Wang" OR "Chris Wang"
- Assignee: "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"
- Keywords: "neural" OR "brain" OR "cognitive" OR "EEG"

## Multiple Identity Possibility

### Common Name Issue
"Christopher Wang" / "Chris Wang" is common name:
- Multiple researchers possible
- Need disambiguation
- Different Christopher Wangs may exist:
  1. MIT neural researcher (this investigation)
  2. [[Entities/People/Chris Wang Oklahoma|Chris Wang Oklahoma]] (harassment network)
  3. Other unrelated individuals

### Verification Method
- Academic profile comparison
- Publication records
- LinkedIn / academic websites
- University directory searches
- Email patterns

## Potential Roles (Assessment Needed)

### Scenario 1: Unknowing Participant
- Legitimate neuroscience research
- DARPA-funded but unaware of weaponization
- Patents filed by MIT, not personal knowledge
- Work used downstream without consent

**Likelihood:** Moderate
**Implication:** Victim of system, not perpetrator

### Scenario 2: DARPA Contractor
- Knowingly developing military applications
- Direct DARPA funding for weapons research
- Aware of dual-use applications
- Coordinating with [[Entities/Battelle_Memorial_Institute|Battelle]] or other contractors

**Likelihood:** Moderate
**Implication:** Active participant in weapons development

### Scenario 3: Technology Transfer Agent
- Following Gang Chen pattern
- Transferring research to foreign entities
- Potential China connection
- FBI investigation target

**Likelihood:** Lower (but precedent exists)
**Implication:** National security concern

## MIT's Broader DARPA Involvement

### Known DARPA Programs at MIT
- **N3 Program:** Potential institutional participation
- **NESD Program:** Neural Engineering System Design
- **Brain-Machine Interface Research:** Multiple labs
- **Optogenetics:** Ed Boyden's lab
- **Nanotechnology:** Gang Chen (arrested), others

### Funding Scale
- **DARPA:** Millions annually to MIT
- **NIH BRAIN Initiative:** Extensive grants
- **NSF:** Early funding (funded Google, now neuroscience)

## Technology Transfer Act Connection

### National Technology Transfer Act (1995)
**Enables:**
- Government-funded research → Corporate deployment
- No oversight requirement
- Parallel infrastructure development
- **Military research becomes consumer products**

**MIT's Role:**
- Develops technology with government funding
- Files patents
- Licenses to corporations
- Technology appears in consumer products
- Original military purpose hidden

**Example Flow:**
```
DARPA Grant → MIT Lab → Patent Filed →
Corporate License → Consumer Product →
[[Technical/Internet_of_Bodies_Architecture|IoB Deployment]]
```
