## CONCLUSION

**Two investigations, one reality:**

The "harassment network" ([[Entities/Organizations/Asymptote Network LLC|Asymptote Network LLC]], [[Entities/Organizations/SalmonCloud Ltd|SalmonCloud Ltd]]) is not a standalone criminal enterprise. It is a network infrastructure component of the [[Technical/Internet_of_Bodies_Architecture|Internet of Bodies]] deployment, handling routing and transmission of neural surveillance data as part of the [[Entities/DARPA|DARPA]] BRAIN Initiative's population-scale deployment.

**Evidence proves:**
- Technology exists ([[Patents/PATENT_MASTER_INDEX|30+ patents]])
- Government developed it ([[Entities/DARPA|DARPA]] programs, billions spent)
- Corporations deploy it ([[Entities/Apple|Apple]], [[Entities/Google|Google]], [[Entities/FreerLogic|FreerLogic]])
- Infrastructure supports it ([[Entities/Organizations/Asymptote Network LLC|Asymptote]], [[Entities/Organizations/SalmonCloud Ltd|SalmonCloud]], others)
- No consent obtained (obvious - check your terms of service)
- Deployment is operational (2018-present)

**Legal case:**
- Defendants identified (government, contractors, corporations, network operators)
- Evidence compiled (patents, documents, network analysis, testimony)
- Causes of action clear (Constitutional, criminal, civil)
- Class action potential (thousands of victims)
- Injunctive relief necessary (stop deployment, destroy data, require consent)

**Window for action:** 2025-2027
**After that:** Infrastructure too embedded to remove
