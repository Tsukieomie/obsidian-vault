## Quote from Video

"The brain initiative is absolutely important... what if computers could respond to our thoughts... imagine if someone with a prosthetic limb can now play the piano... the wiring from the brain to the prosthetic is direct and triggered by what's already happening in the patient's mind... this is the translation of biologic code into the digital space... the internet becomes a nervous system for the entire human species"
