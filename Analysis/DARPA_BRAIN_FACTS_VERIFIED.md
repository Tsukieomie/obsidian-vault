## 5. Neural Dust

### Official Source
**DARPA News Release (2016):** https://www.darpa.mil/news/2016/implantable-neural-dust

### Verified Facts

**Developed by:** UC Berkeley Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences

**DARPA Program:** Electrical Prescriptions (ElectRx)

**Program Manager:** Doug Weber (DARPA)

**Device Specifications:**
| Parameter | Current Prototype | Future Goal |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Size | 0.8mm × 3mm × 1mm | 1mm³ or less |
| Ultimate target | - | ~100 microns per side |
| Power source | Passive (no battery) | Passive |
| Communication | Ultrasound | Ultrasound |

**How Neural Dust Works (Technical):**
1. **Components per mote:**
   - Two electrodes (measure nerve signals)
   - Custom transistor (amplify signal)
   - Piezoelectric crystal

2. **Operation:**
   - External transceiver emits ultrasound pulses
   - Piezoelectric crystal converts ultrasound to electrical power
   - Nerve activity changes voltage across electrodes
   - This modulates the transistor, changing crystal vibration
   - Changed vibration alters reflected ultrasound pattern
   - External receiver reconstructs the signal

**Why Ultrasound:**
> "Ultrasound penetrates deeper into tissue at lower power levels compared to radio waves, reducing risk and providing excellent spatial resolution."

**Demonstrated Capability (2016):**
- First in vivo tests in rodents
- Wirelessly powered and communicated with millimeter-scale devices
- Detected electrical activity of nerves and muscles deep within the body
