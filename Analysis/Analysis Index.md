## Usage Guide

### Starting an Investigation Session
1. Review [[Investigation Dashboard]]
2. Check [[Action Items]] for priorities
3. Review [[Timeline]] for context
4. Check [[Evidence Tracking]] for pending items

### After Making Discoveries
1. Document in appropriate entity file
2. Update [[Timeline]] with discovery
3. Update [[Evidence Tracking]] status
4. Add evidence to [[Evidence Repository]]
5. Update [[Connection Map]] if needed
6. Review [[Action Items]] for new tasks
7. Update [[Investigation Dashboard]] if significant

### Weekly Review Process
1. Review [[Action Items]] completion
2. Update [[Evidence Tracking]] status
3. Review [[Risk Matrix]] for changes
4. Update [[Investigation Dashboard]]
5. Plan next week's priorities

### Before Reporting to Authorities
1. Review [[Evidence Repository]]
2. Check [[Evidence Tracking]] for verified items
3. Review [[Threat Assessment]]
