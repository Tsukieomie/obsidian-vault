### Wang, Jing / Junyuan Wang - REQUIRES CLARIFICATION

**Current Confusion:**
- ARIN lists "Wang, Jing" (WANGJ100-ARIN) as technical and NOC contact
- Investigation focuses on "Junyuan Wang"
- Are these the same person or different people?

**Evidence For Same Person:**
- Both are Wang family name

- Chinese naming conventions allow for name variations
- "Jing" could be part of full name (Wang Jing Yuan = Junyuan?)

**Evidence For Different People:**
- Completely different given names (Jing vs Junyuan)
- No public evidence connecting the names
- [[Jing Wang]] file exists referencing Duke TA (assessed as unrelated)
- Both are common Chinese names

**Critical Priority:** DETERMINE IF WANGJ100-ARIN = Junyuan Wang

**Verification Methods:**
1. Cross-reference [[SalmonCloud Ltd]] director Junyuan Wang details with ARIN
2. Check GitHub JUNYUANGO commit emails for ARIN handle patterns
3. Search for "Wang Jing Yuanyuan" or similar name variations
4. Contact ARIN directly (if investigation authority permits)
