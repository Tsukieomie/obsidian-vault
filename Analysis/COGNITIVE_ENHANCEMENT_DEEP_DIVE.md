## What Does "Smarter" Actually Mean?

When we say the research made them "smarter," we're talking about specific, measurable improvements in:

1. **Attention** - Ability to focus and sustain concentration
2. **Memory** - Working memory, recall, retention
3. **Processing Speed** - How fast the brain processes information
4. **Executive Function** - Planning, decision-making, problem-solving
5. **Perception** - Enhanced awareness, pattern recognition
6. **Endurance** - Cognitive stamina, reduced fatigue
