**Key Finding:** Confirmed Intel connection for a Junyuan Wang matching profile characteristics. Significant new corporate intelligence on SalmonCloud Ltd obtained.

## Investigation 1: Junyuan Wang Intel Connection

### Priority Level

- Patent database searches

### Findings

**CONFIRMED: Intel Corporation Employment**

**Profile Identified:**
- Name: Junyuan Wang
- Title: Senior Linux Driver Engineer
- Company: Intel Corporation
- Locations: Shanghai, China AND Santa Clara, California (multiple sources)
- Education: Xi'an Jiaotong University
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/junyuan-wang-23394449/

2. ZoomInfo (business intelligence database)
3. ResearchGate (scientific contributions)
4. IEEE Xplore (author profile)
5. Patent databases (Intel Corporation applications)

### Critical Assessment

**IMPORTANT VERIFICATION NEEDED:**
While Intel employment is CONFIRMED for "Junyuan Wang" matching this profile, we must verify this is the SAME Junyuan Wang associated with:
- GitHub username: JUNYUANGO
- [[Asymptote Network LLC]]
- [[SalmonCloud Ltd]]

**Indicators Suggesting Same Person:**
1. Technical expertise aligns (Linux, networking, security)
2. Geographic locations include US and China (matches international operations pattern)
3. Appropriate skill level for network infrastructure operations
4. Timeline plausible (see SalmonCloud findings below)

**Indicators Requiring Clarification:**
1. GitHub username JUNYUANGO not found in searches (may be private or incorrect)
2. No direct link found between LinkedIn profile and SalmonCloud Ltd
3. Common name - multiple Junyuan Wangs exist

**Confidence Level:** 70% (Strong circumstantial match, requires definitive verification)

### Next Steps Required
1. Verify GitHub username JUNYUANGO exists and is associated with this person
2. Cross-reference email patterns from GitHub commits with Intel profile
3. Verify Xi'an Jiaotong University education against other sources
4. Check if LinkedIn profile shows SalmonCloud Ltd in employment history
5. Analyze timing of Intel employment vs SalmonCloud activities

### Significance Assessment

**If Confirmed (Same Person):**
- CRITICAL: Intel corporation employee conducting network harassment operations
- Corporate espionage implications
- Access to advanced technical capabilities and knowledge
- Potential violation of Intel employment terms
- Criminal charges more severe (abuse of position)
- Intel Corporation may have legal liability issues

**If NOT Confirmed (Different People):**
- Name coincidence
- Reduces threat assessment (no corporate tech access)
- Maintains focus on network operations only

### Evidence Quality
**High:** Intel employment documented through multiple independent sources
**Medium:** Connection to investigation subject requires verification
**Action:** Treat as unverified until definitive linkage established

## Investigation 2: SalmonCloud Ltd Corporate Intelligence

### Priority Level
HIGH - Confirmed associate of [[Asymptote Network LLC]]

### Research Conducted
- UK Companies House official records
- Endole business intelligence database
- Corporate filings search

### Findings

**SIGNIFICANT NEW INTELLIGENCE OBTAINED**

**Corporate Details:**
- Company Number: 15025687
- Company Name: SALMONCLOUD LTD
- Incorporation Date: 25 July 2023
- Status: Active
- Registered Office: London, Greater London
- Country: United Kingdom

**Corporate Structure (from Endole):**
- Officers: 1
- Shareholders: 5 (names not publicly available without paid access)
- Persons with Significant Control (PSC): 1

**Person with Significant Control:**
- Name: Junyuan Wang
- Role: Director
- Occupation: Student
- Nationality: Chinese
- Location: Lives in United States
- Date of Birth: January 2002 (age approximately 23)

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**

1. **Age Factor:** Born January 2002 (age ~23)
   - This is YOUNG for a Senior Linux Driver Engineer at Intel
   - Intel senior positions typically require 5-10+ years experience
   - However, exceptional talent can advance quickly in tech
   - "Student" occupation noted - may be graduate student

2. **Timeline Analysis:**
   - Incorporated: July 25, 2023 (relatively recent)
   - This is AFTER the investigation timeframe began
   - Suggests active, ongoing operations

3. **Occupation Discrepancy:**
   - Listed as "Student" on Companies House
   - LinkedIn shows "Senior Linux Driver Engineer at Intel"
   - Possible explanations:
     a) Different individuals (name coincidence)
     b) Student status outdated (Companies House filing from 2023)
     c) Deliberate obfuscation
     d) Part-time student / full-time employee

4. **Geographic Pattern:**
   - "Lives in United States" matches investigation pattern
   - Chinese nationality matches Intel Shanghai connection
   - London registration for UK operations
   - Consistent with international network operations

### Shareholder Information

**5 Shareholders Identified (Names Not Public):**
