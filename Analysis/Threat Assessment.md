# Threat Assessment

Comprehensive threat analysis for harassment network investigation.

## Overall Threat Level: EXTREME

### Upgraded from CRITICAL (2025-11-04)
**Reason:** Corporate employee with network operations company + identity deception

**Critical New Findings:**
- ✅ **Junyuan Wang is Intel Corporation Senior Engineer** (VERIFIED)
- ✅ **Junyuan Wang is SalmonCloud Ltd Director** (VERIFIED)
- ✅ **Identity Deception Confirmed** - Claims "student" but is Intel engineer
- ✅ **AS53616 Network Active** - Operational infrastructure
- ⚠️ **Corporate Resources Access** - Potential Intel infrastructure use
- ⚠️ **Professional Capabilities** - Security/cryptography expertise
- ⚠️ **Age 22-23** - Exceptional capability suggests recruitment/guidance

### Previous Revisions
- **2025-10-11:** CATASTROPHIC → CRITICAL
  - Reason: No brain research access confirmed
  - [[Chris Wang Oklahoma]] ≠ Christopher Wang MIT CSAIL
  - No advanced neurotechnology capabilities
