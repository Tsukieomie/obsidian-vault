## HENDRICUS LOOS PATENTS - Nervous System Manipulation

### The Inventor

**Hendricus G. Loos** (1925-2017)
- Dutch-born American research physicist
- Delft University of Technology graduate
- Worked at: Plasmadyne Corp., Douglas Aircraft, UC (Associate Professor)
- Filed 7 patents on nervous system manipulation
- Some speculate connection to classified programs

### US Patent 6,506,148 (2003)
**"Nervous system manipulation by electromagnetic fields from monitors"**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Patent Number | 6,506,148 B2 |
| Filed | 2001 |
| Granted | January 14, 2003 |
| Inventor | Hendricus G. Loos |

**What It Does:**
Manipulates the human nervous system through pulsed electromagnetic fields emitted by computer monitors and TVs.

**Technical Description:**
> "Physiological effects have been observed in a human subject in response to stimulation of the skin with weak electromagnetic fields that are pulsed with certain frequencies near ½ Hz or 2.4 Hz, such as to excite a sensory resonance."

**Effects by Frequency:**
| Frequency | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| ~0.5 Hz | Relaxation, sleepiness, ptosis, "tonic smile," sexual excitement |
| ~2.4 Hz | Slowing of cortical activities |

**Critical Warning (from patent):**
> "Certain monitors can emit electromagnetic field pulses that excite a sensory resonance in a nearby subject, through image pulses that are so weak as to be subliminal. This is unfortunate since it opens a way for mischievous application of the invention, whereby people are exposed unknowingly to manipulation of their nervous systems for someone else's purposes."

## LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE

### For [[LEGAL_CASE_FRAMEWORK|Legal Case]]

**Patents as Evidence:**
- Cannot be dismissed as "conspiracy theory"
- Government assignees (NASA, Air Force) = state action
- Published specifications = capabilities documented
- Filing dates = timeline of development

**Causes of Action Supported:**
1. **Fourth Amendment** - Patents prove warrantless surveillance capability exists
2. **Human Experimentation** - Technology exists, was it tested on unwitting subjects?
3. **Conspiracy** - Multiple agencies, coordinated development
4. **Fraud** - Capabilities hidden from public

### Expert Witness Value

**Patent Attorneys:**
- Can testify to patent validity
- Explain technical claims to jury
- Prove capability from specifications

**Dr. Chuck Jorgensen (NASA):**
- Direct knowledge of thought-reading technology
- Government employee - can be subpoenaed
- Published extensively on subject
