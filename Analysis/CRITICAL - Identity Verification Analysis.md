**Confidence Level:** 40% (same person questionable)

## Investigation Impact Assessment

### CRITICAL QUESTION: Which Junyuan Wang is the Network Operator?

**Scenario A: GitHub JUNYUANGO = SalmonCloud Director (NOT Intel employee)**

**If True:**
- Network operator is University of Minnesota student
- Age ~23, Minneapolis location
- No Intel Corporation connection
- Reduces threat assessment (no corporate tech access)
- Maintains UK company director status
- Criminal investigation still viable but reduced severity

**Evidence Supporting:**
- Student status matches both profiles
- US location matches both
- Email patterns need verification
- Timeline compatible

**Evidence Against:**
- No obvious UK connection for London-registered company
- Technical expertise level for AS53616 operations

**Scenario B: Intel Employee = SalmonCloud Director (NOT GitHub JUNYUANGO)**

**If True:**
- Network operator is Intel Senior Engineer
- Advanced technical capabilities
- Corporate espionage implications
- "Student" occupation is either outdated or deceptive
- Age discrepancy concerns remain
- Significantly higher threat level

**Evidence Supporting:**
- Technical capability matches network operations
- International operations pattern (Shanghai/Santa Clara/London)
- Advanced Linux/security expertise relevant

**Evidence Against:**
- Occupation listed as "Student" contradicts Senior Engineer role
- Age vs experience timeline questionable
- No verified link to GitHub JUNYUANGO

**Scenario C: Three Different People Named Junyuan Wang**

**If True:**
- Coincidental name overlap
- Investigation misidentified subjects
- Need to restart identity verification
- SalmonCloud director could be neither GitHub nor Intel person

**Evidence Supporting:**
- "Junyuan Wang" is not an uncommon Chinese name
- Clear differences between GitHub and Intel profiles
- Occupation/education/location mismatches

**Evidence Against:**
- GitHub Analysis document claims JUNYUANGO was analyzed
- Investigation has treated them as single person
- Too coincidental for harassment investigation

## Verification Requirements

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

**Priority 1: Email Cross-Reference**
1. Obtain email addresses from SalmonCloud official documents
2. Compare with:
   - wang9747@umn.edu
   - junyuangogogo@gmail.com
   - Any Intel-associated emails
3. Check GitHub commit history for JUNYUANGO repositories for email patterns
4. Cross-reference all email variants

**Priority 2: GitHub Forensic Re-Analysis**
1. Review [[Technical/GitHub Analysis]] methodology
2. Verify which repositories were actually analyzed
3. Confirm frank2002, JUNYUANGO, CarlosalbertoMontt collaboration
4. Extract commit author emails from archived repositories
5. Verify JUNYUANGO commit emails match profile emails

**Priority 3: SalmonCloud Document Acquisition**
1. Purchase Confirmation Statement from UK Companies House (£1-3)
2. Verify shareholder list
3. Check for email addresses in corporate filings
4. Confirm Junyuan Wang director details

**Priority 4: Educational Verification**
1. Verify Intel Junyuan Wang's Xi'an Jiaotong University education
2. Check for any UMN connection for Intel employee
3. Timeline analysis of educational history

**Priority 5: Age/Timeline Reconciliation**
1. If SalmonCloud director (born Jan 2002, age ~23) is Intel employee:
   - Education timeline: When did XJTU education occur?
   - Career timeline: When did Intel employment start?
   - How does a 23-year-old become Senior Engineer?
2. Intel early career programs, exceptional talent tracks
3. Graduate student scenarios

### VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY

**Step 1: GitHub Repository Forensic Analysis**
```bash
# If repositories were archived, extract commit emails
git log --all --format='%ae %an' | sort | uniq

# Expected outputs to check:
# - wang9747@umn.edu
# - junyuangogogo@gmail.com
# - OR completely different emails
```

**Step 2: Cross-Reference Matrix**
Create verification matrix comparing:
- Email addresses
- Educational institutions
- Locations
- Occupations
- Ages
- Technical specializations
- Timeline of activities

**Step 3: Definitive Identification**
- Email match = High confidence identity
- Institution match = Medium confidence identity
- Location match alone = Low confidence (not definitive)

## Threat Assessment Impact

### Current Assessment: CRITICAL (unchanged)
**Rationale:** Regardless of which Junyuan Wang is involved, confirmed capabilities remain:
- AS53616 network infrastructure control
- International operations (US/UK/Hong Kong)
- BGP routing and DDoS capabilities
- SalmonCloud Ltd corporate structure
- Professional operational security

### If Scenario A (UMN Student):
- Threat Level: HIGH (downgrade from CRITICAL)
- No corporate resource access
- Advanced student with network expertise
- Criminal charges: Network harassment, computer crimes
- Intelligence Operation Probability: 60% (down from 80%)

### If Scenario B (Intel Employee):
- Threat Level: CRITICAL (maintained)
- Corporate resource access concerns
- Corporate espionage dimension
- Intel employment terms violation
- Criminal charges: Enhanced severity
- Intelligence Operation Probability: 85% (up from 80%)

### If Scenario C (Unknown Third Person):
- Threat Level: UNKNOWN (requires re-assessment)
- Investigation identity assumptions invalid
- Restart verification process
- Re-evaluate all connections

## Previous Investigation Assumptions

### Assumptions That May Be Invalid

1. **GitHub JUNYUANGO = Intel Junyuan Wang**
   - Status: LIKELY FALSE (85% confidence different people)
   - Impact: Major investigation revision needed

2. **GitHub Analysis identified correct person**
   - Status: REQUIRES VERIFICATION
   - Impact: Email extraction from archived repos needed

3. **Single Junyuan Wang responsible for operations**
   - Status: UNCERTAIN
   - Impact: Could be different person, or multiple Junyuan Wangs

### Assumptions That Remain Valid

1. **SalmonCloud Ltd exists and has Junyuan Wang as director**
   - Status: CONFIRMED (UK Companies House official record)
   - Evidence Quality: HIGH

2. **AS53616 network operations confirmed**
   - Status: CONFIRMED
   - Evidence Quality: HIGH
   - Note: Independent of specific individual identity

3. **International harassment network exists**
   - Status: CONFIRMED
   - Evidence Quality: HIGH
   - Note: Operator identity uncertain but operations confirmed

## Recommendations

### CRITICAL PRIORITY

1. **STOP** treating Intel employee and GitHub JUNYUANGO as same person
2. **VERIFY** which Junyuan Wang is actually associated with SalmonCloud operations
3. **EXTRACT** email addresses from archived GitHub repositories
4. **PURCHASE** SalmonCloud Confirmation Statement from Companies House
5. **REVISE** investigation assumptions based on identity verification

### HIGH PRIORITY

6. Review all evidence attributions to ensure correct person
7. Re-analyze GitHub forensic data for actual email addresses
8. Cross-reference all known email patterns
9. Timeline analysis of all activities
10. Update all entity profiles with verification status

### INVESTIGATION INTEGRITY

**This finding demonstrates:**
- Proper verification methodology catching errors
- Importance of source verification
- Need for definitive email/document cross-reference
- Investigation self-correction process working

**NOT a failure, but a critical correction that strengthens case quality**

## Updated Confidence Levels

### Identity Matches

**GitHub JUNYUANGO = UMN Student Junyuan Wang:** 100% (verified from profile)

**GitHub JUNYUANGO = Intel Employee Junyuan Wang:** 15% (likely different people)

**GitHub JUNYUANGO = SalmonCloud Director Junyuan Wang:** 60% (possible, needs email verification)

**Intel Employee = SalmonCloud Director:** 40% (questionable due to occupation mismatch)

**SalmonCloud Director exists:** 100% (UK Companies House official record)

**At least one Junyuan Wang involved in SalmonCloud:** 100% (confirmed director)

**Specific identity of network operator:** 40% (requires email verification)

## Next Investigation Session Priorities

1. GitHub repository email extraction (archived repositories)
2. SalmonCloud Confirmation Statement purchase
3. Email cross-reference analysis
4. Identity verification conclusion
5. Update all investigation documents with corrected identities
6. Threat assessment revision if needed
